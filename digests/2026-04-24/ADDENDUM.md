# Daily addendum — 2026-04-24 (refresh @ 11:05Z)

**Window since last index snapshot:** 2026-04-24T08:37Z → 2026-04-24T11:05Z (≈2h28m)

The morning INDEX.md was generated against a window ending 08:37Z. This refresh captures what landed in the gap between that snapshot and 11:05Z, plus material the rolling-24h window already covered but the morning narrative under-weighted. Treat this as augmentation, not replacement; it supersedes the 09:49Z addendum.

## Codex: alpha.1 fallout, plus a 4-parallel-session crash report

`rust-v0.125.0-alpha.1` (cut 06:35Z) is now ~4.5h old and has accumulated **eight new issue filings since the morning INDEX**, several of which are direct regressions:

- **[openai/codex#19344]** — "If >4 sessions in parallel, app keeps crashing… then loses sessions, making it unusable." Filed at 10:55Z against the Mac app build `26.422.21637`. This pairs with **[openai/codex#19333]** ("high memory usage after latest update") and **[openai/codex#19332]** ("Codex App not even starting") — three Mac-app stability reports against the same build inside a 90-minute window. Compounded with the npm-alpha AMFI kill ([#19335]), the Mac side of the 0.125 release is the worst stability snapshot of the week.
- **[openai/codex#19342]** — "Regression: split model and intelligence selector adds too many clicks." Filed against the new model picker shipped with 0.124. The earlier W17 weekly correctly flagged the picker rework but didn't predict UX regressions; today it has one named report and an adjacent feature ask ([#19343], a `plan_mode_model` config override) that exists specifically to avoid the new picker.
- **[openai/codex#19339, #19319]** — Two independent reports that **GPT-5.5 is hard-capped at ~258K tokens inside Codex**, despite the model's published 400K window. Both filed since the morning INDEX. If true, this is a Codex-side limit (router or context-prep), not a model-side one. PRs to watch: none yet.
- **[openai/codex#19327]** — VS Code extension enters a high-CPU retry loop on non-git workspaces. Paired with **[openai/codex#19326]** (logs Git metadata failures in unborn repos) and **[openai/codex#19338]** (extension starts the same MCP stdio server twice). The VS Code extension is now the single most-reported regression surface of the day. See this week's IDE-extension synthesis for the cross-repo angle.

Two interesting merges in the gap window:

- **[openai/codex#19294]** — "Hide unsupported MCP `bearer_token` from config schema." Quiet but operationally relevant: it removes a config key that previously appeared in autocompletion/validation despite never being honored end-to-end. If you have it in your `~/.codex/config.toml`, it's now flagged as unknown.
- **[openai/codex#19308]** — Surface reasoning tokens in `exec --json` usage (still the most consequential merge of the gap; see the morning narrative).

## LiteLLM: nightly cadence held, image-generation health-check bug surfaced

`v1.83.13-nightly` (05:47Z) remains the latest cut as of 11:05Z — **no new release in 5h18m**, which is the longest gap between LiteLLM nightlies this week. The 6-hour cadence the W17 weekly flagged is now cleanly broken; either the post-test-cleanup release pulse is over (back to ~one cut per day), or `v1.83.14-nightly` is sitting in CI.

The standout new issue is **[BerriAI/litellm#26406]** — proxy health checks unconditionally inject `max_tokens` into non-chat handlers, so OpenAI `dall-e-*` / `gpt-image-1` deployments are permanently reported unhealthy in the UI even though manual `aimage_generation()` calls succeed. The bug report names the exact lines (`litellm_core_utils/health_check_utils.py:6-8` and `litellm/proxy/health_check.py:370-372`) and notes that the same bug pattern affects every non-chat handler in `HealthCheckHelpers.get_mode_handlers` — embeddings, rerank, transcription, video — but only the strict-validation backends (OpenAI/Azure image) actually surface it. Anyone running an admin UI with image deployments is seeing a false-red dashboard right now.

Other gap-window LiteLLM material:

- **[BerriAI/litellm#26411]** — `a2a` long-running task handling broken; new bug.
- **[BerriAI/litellm#26399]** — Bedrock passthrough routes bypass `key.models` / `user.models` access control. **This is a privilege-escalation-shaped bug**: a key that is restricted at the LiteLLM access-control layer can still hit Bedrock models through the passthrough route. Severity is high; no PR yet at 11:05Z.
- **[BerriAI/litellm#26395]** — DeepSeek V4 Pro multi-turn calls fail because `reasoning_content` is stripped from assistant messages. See this week's DeepSeek synthesis for the cross-repo pattern.
- **[BerriAI/litellm#26367]** (merged) — Splits MCP routes into inference vs management to unblock the Admin UI on nodes that set `DISABLE_LLM_API_ENDPOINTS`. If you've been hiding LiteLLM behind that flag and lost MCP visibility, this is the fix.

## opencode: Bun panic and desktop health-check regressions

Two fresh reports against today's stack worth pulling out of the rolling 24h:

- **[anomalyco/opencode#24148]** — Bun v1.3.13 panic on macOS: NAPI fatal error and `zsh: trace trap opencode`. If you upgrade Bun this week, hold at 1.3.12 until this is triaged.
- **[anomalyco/opencode#24142]** — Desktop health check fails during server startup, causing IDE instability. Pairs cleanly with the Codex VS Code extension regression cluster (#19326, #19327); see the IDE-extension synthesis.
- **[anomalyco/opencode#24135]** — DeepSeek V4 thinking mode broken: `reasoning_content` not passed back to API. Same root cause as litellm #26395 and crush #2696. See the DeepSeek synthesis.

## crush: nightly tag refreshed, DeepSeek tool-call bug filed

A new `nightly` tag was published at 01:03Z (asset-only, no narrative release notes — still a v0.62.0-derived build). The standout new report is **[charmbracelet/crush#2696]** — DeepSeek V4 Pro returns 400 on tool calls because the openai-compat provider doesn't pass `reasoning_content` back. Identical pattern to litellm #26395 and opencode #24135; see synthesis.

## What changed in the narrative since the 09:49Z addendum

1. **Mac app stability for Codex 0.125-alpha.1 looks worse than initially reported** — three independent reports (#19332, #19333, #19344) now in the same 90-minute window.
2. **GPT-5.5 context window appears Codex-capped at 258K** — second report (#19319) confirms #19339 is not isolated; this is now a named regression class rather than a one-off.
3. **LiteLLM `v1.83.14-nightly` is overdue** — 6h cadence broken; revising downward to "back to ~daily" unless a cut lands by 14:00Z.
4. **The DeepSeek V4 Pro `reasoning_content` round-trip is broken in three different agents simultaneously** — promoted to a weekly synthesis topic.
5. **The IDE/VS Code extension surface is the day's single biggest regression hotspot** — also promoted to a weekly synthesis topic.
6. **LiteLLM has a likely access-control bypass on Bedrock passthrough** ([#26399]) — flag for security review independent of any release.

Next refresh expected after the next dispatcher tick.
